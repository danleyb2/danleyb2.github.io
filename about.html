              Hello, I'm Nyaundi Brian, a Full-Stack developer and electronics enthusiast.
              I am currently at <a href="https://platerecognizer.com/">Platerecognizer</a> building Vision AI models and
              creating integrations around them such as APIs, sites and scripts.
              I was previously an Implementations Lead at InterIntel Technologies across their various products such as Nenasasa
              (a Bulk SMS Platform) and Mipay (a Payment Gateway).
            </p>

        <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
            <p>
                I am currently highly active on the <a href="https://sifhic.com/">Sifhic</a>
                project.
                However, I'm the primary author of the projects outlined below and
                contributor to 100s of others. I also run or have otherwise
                created a number of <a href="/portfolio">web services and companies</a>.
